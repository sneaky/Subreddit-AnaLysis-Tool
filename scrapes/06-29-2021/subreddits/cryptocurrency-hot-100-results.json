            "selftext": "Widely recognized as a leading security and cryptocurrency researcher, and a serial entrepreneur, Sergio Demian Lerner has co-founded several technology companies: RSK Labs, Coinspect, Coinfabrik, and ATI-Medical. In 2011 he joined the Bitcoin community and collaborated to strengthen the security of the Bitcoin Core by responsible disclosing 9 vulnerabilities. In early 2013, he created QixCoin, the first Turing-complete cryptocurrency. In 2015, he performed one of the first security and design audits of Ethereum and collaborated in the design of the platform.  Also in 2015, he designed RSK, the first Bitcoin sidechain. Since 2011 he has proposed more than 70 technical improvements to Bitcoin, Ethereum and RSK, for improved blockchain privacy, interoperability, security, decentralization, scalability, fairness, and latency.\nFor the purposes of this AMA, we would like to focus on RIF and RSK technologies, the relationship between RSK/RIF and platforms like Liquid and Ethereum, RSK merge-mining, the RSK two-way-peg security, current projects in the works, and Sergio\u2019s contributions to Bitcoin.\n\nThe AMA date is June 29, 10am GMT -3 to 12pm GMT-3.

His strategy was to put a few thousand in and watch the charts meticulously every few seconds. I even saw him swing trading and swapping coins, so I decided to learn everything I could about crypto and see if he was getting \"scammed.\" \n\nI learned a lot. I watched him tell our friends to buy doge coin, saw him put lump sums into BTC and BITCOIN CASH, and heard him tell me about lots of coins that seemed like they wouldn't pan out long term and I tried to hold my breath. \n\nAt this point (around April) I thought, hey, I know a little bit now, time to start my portfolio. I did something different than him, and put 25 dollars in each week. He kind of made a little fun of me, said it was \"cute\" that I was investing and trying, and also said it was kinda pointless to put that little amount of money in. \n\nThen came the \"crash\" that I was completely prepared for and mentally ready to see, and I just ... continued to put in my money weekly. He \"no longer wanted to talk crypto as much\" and stopped putting in money because all of his was already invested. \n\nI am proud to say that as of today (because I started building with one coin vs. His 10-15) ...\n\nMY BITCOIN IS WORTH MORE THAN HIS!\n\nEdit: for you weirdos saying I'm in a toxic relationship .... have a drink",

But today Bitcoin moved into a descending pentagon pattern, currently testing 35k to the upper falsetto Trend Line of 37k. This indicates Bitcoin could possibly range back downwards to 30k if the Phase 3 Burgandy Trend Line isn\u2019t held in the 24-hour period. \n\nIf we *do* hold the Burgandy trend line, we could rocket past the 37k mark and overcome the asymmetric volatility, just like we saw at the end of last cycle\u2019s oscillating Morningstone quadrant phase. \n\nIn short: it\u2019s quickly approaching Truth Time\u2122\ufe0f for Bitcoin. If we can\u2019t hold the Burgandy line, I see a re-test of the 21-day SVP directional level. But if we *can* hold the Burgandy line, and if Bitcoin blasts through the Tamland 27-week support metric, the upward pressure could lead to a downward stochastic indication of a Rainbow Cross. If that happens, all bets are off.\n\nPlease subscribe to my shocked-face-thumbnail YouTube channel for more insight and analysis.",

Treasury sends 62.5k ICP to insider 2 hours before trading opens\n2. Insider sends 62k ICP to Coinbase/Binance addresses over the course of 5 days after listing\n3. Exchanges move this ICP to central addresses within 20 mins of deposit\n\n**Implications**\n\n* The Treasury and insiders sent about 75% of the total ICP deposited on exchanges.\n* We can only assume these tokens were sold, as there is no \u201cdirect and clear\u201d evidence that they were.\n* The assumption is safe because:\n\n1. The price plummeted as these deposits were made\n2. The only thing to do with ICP on an exchange is to sell it\n\n* A possible counter argument is that they wanted to use Coinbase for token custody\n   * This is unlikely because the token holders (Dfinity and insiders) would most likely have the capability to securely store tokens and they would have been incentivized to store them in a way that maintained their custody of them(at the time of the dump, their tokens were worth hundreds of millions).\n   * Secondly, **ICP protocol distributes ICP rewards to holders who lock their tokens in the network**. If there is no intent to sell, holders are incentivized to earn rewards rather than store them on exchanges\n   * Thirdly, and most simply, the historic price drop indicates mass selling.\n\n**Off-Chain Analysis**\n\n* There was a lack of transparency regarding token allocation and unlocking as there is very little public information in the way of token unlock schedules\n* Contrast this to UniSwap, who released breakdowns for allocation by category of holder, and a breakdown of the unlocking of the treasury\n* Dfinity\u2019s founder sent a twitter reply claiming: \n   * \u201cFoundation didn't vest itself but plans on putting most of its ICP into neurons. It is doing this carefully to make sure foundation+team members don't control the network (you wouldn't believe it based upon what you hear, but in actual fact, we care a lot about decentralization!)\u201d\n* **Having no vesting essentially means that token holders are less incentivized to hold their tokens should something happen with the project(like a rug pull, team dump, or VC dump)**\n\n**Seed Supporter\u2019s Struggles**\n\n* At time of launch, seed supporters were entitled to about 25% of the total ICP\n* **These initial investors seem to not have been aware of how to access their tokens or how the tokens would unlock until listing day**\n* Dfinity published an article on Medium on how to access seed tokens\n   * This article explains that seed investors would be subject to a 4-year unlocking schedule:\n      * \u201cSeed donors will receive all of their ICP tokens at Genesis Unlock, but these will be staked inside 49voting neurons within the NNS. Each neuron that is delivered will have a different \u201cdissolve delay\u201dconfigured by the NNS. This configures the minimum period required to unlock the ICP tokens staked inside. One of their neurons will have a dissolve delay of 0 days, allowing the staked ICP tokens to be unlocked immediately, if desired (subject to applicableAML/KYC verification). Another will have a dissolve delay of approximately 30 days, another of 60 days, another of 90 days, and so on.(Note:Configured dissolve delays may have some small random number of days added or subtracted by the NNS).\u201d \n* The provided set of steps to retrieve seed tokens is complicated and technical, with users reporting bugs.\n   * **The steps could not be performed on Windows or new Macs with M1 chips**\n* Dfinity support was unsurprisingly lacking\n   * Users on the support forum report being redirected back to the forum after submitting tickets for their issues\n   * Some users report buying new computers to access their tokens.\n* If Dfinity intended to dump, it would make sense to effectively disallow seed investors to access and sell their tokens\n* Many seed investors were forced to watch as they watched what would have been a life-changing investment slip through their fingers\n\n**Implications**\n\n* Any one of these pieces of evidence may easily be swept under the rug as a new project fumbling through release.\n* As the pieces come together, it seems clear that there was intent behind all of these events.\n* This rug pull event stresses the need for better analytics on cryptocurrencies\n   * ICP buyers should have known about suspicious token flows and off-chain activity.",

At the time, Chainlink was $12.56, while Nano was $1.09. In the spirit of \"put your Moons where your mouth is\", we agreed that the winner would get 10,000 Moons from the other. So what happened? Well..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chainlink versus Nano graph](https://preview.redd.it/xrjo2ls7h9871.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=24487dcaca49792f2bbe6514ab2645e9ae92c4ff)\n\nStarting point is the price at December 28th for both, end point is June 28th for both. Chainlink went to $18.86, Nano went to $4.89.\n\nI'm glad to see that u/poopymcpoppy12 also gained, since Chainlink is up since then, but fortunately for me Nano has increased in price more, percentage-wise. Luckily, Poopy has [17k Moons](https://i.imgur.com/mvkWOKD.png) ([source](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0xdf82c9014f127243ce1305dfe54151647d74b27a?a=0xAB23CF32599D66A7E11368a43A7E6c26Aaafcb59)) so they can settle the bet.\n\nAs far as I know, this is the biggest Moons wager that has been placed so far, and I personally find it pretty fun that I was involved in it (and that I won, of course). u/poopymcpoppy12 has settled the bet in the meantime - they've immortalised themselves by honoring the bet. Scroll down in the thread to give them some sweet karma to hopefully regain some of those moons.\n\nIf anyone wants engage in a new wager I'm always up for it!",

            "selftext": "I cannot believe how little this many transactions cost on Polygon. On Ethereum, the gas fees alone would have likely been in the thousands of dollars.\n\nI've been using Polygon for about 6 months now. No, I'm not a crypto day trader and I never intended to have to transact this in such a short period of time. However, I lost money in an alleged [hack](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-protocol-easyfi-reports-hack) on the DeFi Polygon network protocol EasyFi. This occurred on 4/19, and at that time, the stolen EASY tokens were worth $75M. $6M of that was in stablecoin liquidity pools, and I had several thousand dollars invested in their USDC LP.\n\nTo their credit, the EasyFi team didn't run away from this. For liquidity providers like me, they compensated each address with 25% of their deposited funds in USDC.\n\nFor the other 75%, they airdropped tokens that you could redeem 1:1 for EZ gradually over time. They called these EZ IOUs.\n\nWithout getting into too much [detail](https://medium.com/easify-network/final-compensation-distribution-7d4acfaf1176) about how this all worked, depending on how much money you had in the LP at the time of the hack, it could take you several months and hundreds to thousands of transactions to fully swap your EZ IOUs for EZ. For me, it took a 2 months, on and off, and 537 transactions.\n\nAlthough I knew Polygon's fees were very, very low, I was worried the fees for so many transactions would add up, and I wasn't really tracking them. However, I had a chance to look my address's Polyscan data yesterday and much to my relief, all of these transactions only cost me an additional $0.057 total.\n\nAgain, I cannot believe how little this many transactions cost on Polygon. Add to that super fast transactions and a growing, healthy network, and I'm very happy so far. \n\n\nRe-reading this, I feel like I sound like a shill, but I just wanted to share my experience for anyone looking to get into Polygon and other L2 solutions.",

            "selftext": "All my friends who are in crypto have not been staking and their reason is they ***didn't know***. I know most of you may know it already but to those who don't, I am about to tell you the importance of staking.\n\n**Staking** is the process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) **blockchain**. On these blockchains, anyone with a minimum-required balance of a specific **cryptocurrency** can validate transactions and earn **Staking** rewards.\n\nIf I am speaking to 5 years old I would say the following. When you stake your cryptos, you usually get to choose how long you are staking it (15 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days) the APY for all of them are different. Let's use ADA as an example. You get around 5% - 8% APY staking ADA on Binance, so if you have 1000 ADAs and you hold them for a year you will get 50 - 80 (5% 8% APY) ADAs for just staking it. That is some nice passive income.\n\n***Staking can make a huge difference if you HOLD long term. So dont forget to stake.***  \n\n\nP.S. Remember to understand the lockup period and the risk that comes along with staking. If cryptos go up/down you are in a forced hold position. So if you are day trading this might not be something you would want to be involved with. However, if you are in it for the long run, the legendary HODLer so to say, then staking is the way to go! ",

            "selftext": "I've compiled some strategies on how to earn interest on stablecoins, as this question gets asked frequently in the daily:\n\n**1. 18.5-20% APY on UST using Anchor Protocol**. Anchor protocol is a savings platform on the Terra network. Decentralized solution.\n\nPros : The platform is adamant on keeping the rate not lower than 18.5% APY. Even during the recent crash, it kept the rate at 18.5% (now it's at 19.4% to be precise). The Terra USD (UST) is the most decentralized algorithmic stablecoin. Nexus Mutual is offering insurance for any smart contract hack on Anchor (2.6% APY).\n\nCons: The platform is only a couple of months old. Terra USD is a lesser know stable coin, and parameters were recently optimized to prevent it from de-pegging. Getting on the Terra system necessitates a bridge, it's easy but an extra step for some.\n\n**2. 12-20% APY on USDC, USDT, BUSD or DAI using Orion Money.** Orion Money is Anchor's little brother on the Ethereum Network. Decentralized solution.\n\nPros: Use the stablecoin of your choice. Ethereum network is more known for some.\n\nCons: 12% is the regular staking APY, if you want a higher staking APY you have to hold the Orion Token. The platform is very new, just launched a couple of weeks ago. Ethereum network fees.\n\n**3. 5-20% APY on USDC/USDT or USDC/DAI by providing liquidity** on Sushiswap or Quickswap on the Matic Network. 10% APY on USDC/USDT on Pancakeswap on the Binance Smart Chain. Decentralized option.\n\nPros: Matic network and BSC have very cheap fees, initial APYs were much higher for several weeks (40%-100%). You can always try to find a new AMM, but it is VERY risky if it's an unknown name (risk of getting hacked).\n\nCons: APYs went down to 5-10%. Still an interesting option. Risk of USDT depegging :P\n\n**4. 8-12% on stablecoins on Nexo/Celsius/Blockfi/Ledn.** Centralized ''banking'' solution.\n\nPros: Some feel more safe on a centralized solution, the interest rates are better than your savings account at the bank. Some insurance is provided (unsure of the coverage).\n\nCons: In order to achieve the 12% you need to hold a significant amount of the native token or a significant portfolio. Interest rates get sometimes dropped without warning.\n\n**5. 4% on USDC on Coinbase or 4-5% on USDT/BUSD on Binance.** Centralized exchange.\n\nPros: Some feel more safe on a centralized exchange they use, the interest rates are better than your savings account at the bank. Some insurance is provided (unsure of the coverage).\n\nCons: Worst savings rate. Can drop interest rates without warning.\n\nSo why isn't everyone using these strategies? **The money is not FDIC insured and there are risks to crypto** : smart contracts get hacked, stablecoins can get de-pegged (not worth 1 USD$), the exchange will leave with your crypto, etc... New insurance strategies are coming to the market for DeFi, but always keep in mind that the interest rates are proportional to the risk.",

            "selftext": "A lot of people recently are asking why they have been airdropped a random token that they have never heard of before so I thought I'd try to shine some light on this phenomenon. \n\nI'd just like to begin by saying that in the event that this does happen, the best thing to do is leave the tokens in your wallet. Don't trade them or attempt to send them anywhere just forget about them, it does not jeopardise the security of your wallet in almost all cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So there are 4 main reasons why this may have occurred:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. A person/group is attempting a dusting attack. *(Relatively unlikely)*\n2. A token is trying to boost its number of holders in order to make it look more appealing to new investors. *(Highly likely)*\n3. *Almost* free advertising. *(Highly likely)*\n4. A mistake. *(Extremely unlikely)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** **A person/ group is attempting a dusting attack.**\n\nA dusting attack is an attack in which a trace amount of crypto, called dust, is sent to thousands and sometimes even hundreds of thousands of wallet addresses. This attack is deployed in order to track these addresses with the hope of \u201cun-masking\u201d or de-anonymizing them. Dust is found most commonly in Binance and Ethereum smart contracts, but it can essentially happen on any blockchain. Attackers use dusting attacks in order to try to identify those with large cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nThe attackers then follow the movement of the funds originated from the dust transaction and combine the affected addresses into one such \"identity\". Then, using additional information from other sources, the attackers can try some educated guessing to figure out the real identities behind those addresses. **Still, this does not give an attacker access to the funds held by an address. It only allows them to maybe know who the owners of the addresses are.**\n\nThe absolute best thing to do when you receive unwanted dust in your wallet is to leave it be and forget about it. The attackers want you to send the tokens elsewhere or try to trade it in order to gain extra information on you, the wallet holder. By doing absolutely nothing with the tokens you are giving the attacker no extra information which will halt the attack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. A token is trying to boost its number of holders in order to make it look more appealing to new investors.**\n\nThis is especially common for Binance and Ethereum smart contracts and is used as a way to deceive new and prospective investors. The team behind this token will airdrop their token to thousands of random addresses in order to boost holder numbers, and make it appear like the token is actually much larger than it is. They will then probably go on to boast about how many X thousands of people are \"hodling strong\" and use it as an incentive for prospective investors.\n\nThis is completely harmless towards your crypto and your wallet and again, the best thing to do is just leave the dust and forget about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.** ***Almost*** **free advertising.**\n\nDusting is also used as an extremely cheap form of advertising. They will often airdrop thousands of addresses an amount of their token equivalent to $0.00001. They do this so that people will check their wallets, see this new mysterious token, and then go and check it out. They also do it so that people will post in forums and groups saying \"did anyone else get X token airdropped\", which again, is *almost* free advertising.\n\nAgain, this is completely harmless and the best thing to do is just leave it and forget about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. A mistake.**\n\nThis is so unlikely that I thought I might not even bother to mention it but I might as well. There is always the slim chance that someone sent their tokens/coins to a wrong address and that wrong address just happened to be yours. If it is a large sum of money it is highly unlikely that it is any of the previously mentioned things in this post, and you will have to decide for yourself what you want to do with your new found wealth. \n\nIf it is a tiny amount of $ it is almost definitely one of the things I have mentioned above, so again, leave it and forget about it, it will not cause you any harm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's it I suppose. Just thought I'd try to shed some light on the situation because of the increase in posts/comments on the topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Here are some extra resources about dusting attacks as I only gave a very brief summary:*\n\n[*https://support.exodus.com/article/1231-what-is-a-dust-attack-and-how-to-mitigate-it*](https://support.exodus.com/article/1231-what-is-a-dust-attack-and-how-to-mitigate-it)\n\n[*https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-dusting-attack-bitcoin*](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-dusting-attack-bitcoin)\n\n[*https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-a-dusting-attack-crypto-exploit-explained*](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-a-dusting-attack-crypto-exploit-explained)",

            "selftext": "This approach has been adopted by a few projects lately (including polyyield today) so I thought I'd warn people about it. Its similar to a rug pull/exit scam/ what ever else you want to. call it. \n\nThe protocol (lets say ShitSwap) launches with regular farms where everything seems to be fine, and accrues volume and TVL gradually, everyone is earning their income and the project earns people's trust and a community forms around this project. This is the precursor to the scam.\n\nOnce enough volume and users are gained, the team suddenly switches farms and puts up a notice saying they are migrating to new farms for various reasons, and thus everyone has to withdraw and re-deposit again, and to make it easy they are setting up a one click withdraw & redeposit function. Now obviously given that the team has earned some trust, many users will withdraw and deposit again into the new farms without asking many questions. To entice users, the new farms will often show higher APY compared to the old farms, so many will jump quickly to capitalize on the APY. \n\nHowever this time around, unknown to those depositing, the new farms have a 100% deposit fee. So everything you deposit will go to the team's wallets and you will be left with nothing. The moment your deposit transaction confirms, funds are gonu. \n\nSo anytime a protocol says to withdraw and re-deposit into a new farm, your spider senses must go up. Never be the first ones to enter these new farms. Only when enough people have confirmed it is safe, it can be considered a good option to enter even if the team asks everyone to migrate. Other than this, if you know coding then you can inspect the smart contracts to know what is going on underneath.",

I remember laughing at someone who tried to pay me $10 they owed me in Bitcoin (I\u2019m an idiot) and here I am today. I jumped on board with Robinhood (mistake) with dogecoin and was hooked instantly. I wanted to learn more, to trade more, to even potentially mine but here I am today not doing any of it. I have about $50 in coinbase about $50 in crypto.com and about $50 in kraken. (And now $0 in robinghood) Now with all that being said and after countless hours of doing my own research and reading DD and looking into Google for answers I have no idea how to start or maintain my own wallet.  Everyone says it\u2019s easy just go to X site and transfer to your wallet. What\u2019s the best storage wallet? How do I transfer my coin from my apps to my wallet? And most importantly how do I know what my wallet address is and what my pass phrase is for if I lose access to it?  I feel like these are simple questions that anyone getting into crypto should know and things I Should\u2019ve had answers to a long time ago. Any help would be appreciated",

I was working my literal a$$ off on a mission to lose a total of 90kg, and in December 2017 hit that goal. I also ended up fired that month, and had a brand new dog, and had just upgraded houses.  It was not the best time to go into business for myself, but what the hell right. \n\nI decided to start writing full-time as a freelancer. I picked up 3 clients during December, and one of them was a crypto exchange. They offered me a 1-year deal, and they offered a modest fiat salary with some of the native exchange tokens as a bonus. These tokens were 90 cents at the time of negotiation so I ended up agreeing to 200 per week, thinking that if I saved all of them for a year, I'd have just enough for the body lift surgery I needed after this extreme weight loss. \n\nI'm an ex-pat and had to go on a visa run in late December, our office closed and when I came back it was the first week of January. The stupid exchange tokens they had offered me were now trading at $7 each. \n\nI stopped.\n\nI stared.\n\nI screamed. \n\nIs this for fucking real????? \n\nMy friend/coworker looked at me with the biggest smile on his face and says, WELCOME TO CRYPTO BABY!!\n\nAnd that was when the mania wave hit, and all of a sudden my world opened up to a whole slew of new possibilities! \n\nBy the end of January I was getting plastic surgery quotes and found a doctor I liked. I got him to take the down payment in crypto, which was totally exciting. \n\nDo you know how exciting it was to be able to put $4000 down toward a surgery in Februry, when I had only made like $12,000 the entire year before??? I can't tell you how dramatically crypto has impacted my life. I look around at my home, and see evidence of the last bullrun all over. From my deep freezer to help keep me on track with food, to the computer I'm typing on now, and the body I am sitting in now. \n\nI am a believer!! Now, it's my second bullrun, I'm now working for a stellar project lead by a team of crypto millionaires, who have come up with a super cool new approach and are literally building a legacy. \n\nI fucking love crpyto.

Cardano never sought external VC funding since they receive sufficient support from IOHK / CFund (and want to avoid centralization that seems to occur when VCs are involved).\n\n2. VCs did provide funding initially but have since exited and no longer list Cardano in their portfolios (this wouldn't necessarily be a positive sign since many VCs still hold Ethereum and Bitcoin)\n\n3. VCs never wanted to invest in Cardano.\n\nDoes anyone have an informed take on this? I'm genuinely curious to know more.",

            "selftext": "**DISCLAIMER**: This is not financial advice. Everything I say here is based on my analysis, which may be flawed. Everything below only applies to 50:50 liquidity pools of high cap coins paired with a stablecoin. It does not apply to other types of pools.  \nI've started researching 50:50 liquidity pools of top 20 cryptocurrencies paired with stablecoins recently and have come to the conclusion that they're not so much of a yield farm, but rather a hedge against strong price action.  \nI decided to calculate how keeping crypto in a pool compares to hodling.  \n**Assumptions**:  \nA hodling period of 1 year is assumed.  \nThe standard Impermanent Loss formula is assumed (2*SQRT(k)/(1+k)-1).  \nAPR is considered to be stable and compounded daily based on that day's pool value.  \nPrice of the underlying asset is considered to be changing daily in a linear fashion, from 100% to N, where N is the price after 1 year.  \nHodled fiat is considered to earn a stable APY of 5%, which is roughly what you'd get by placing it in a stable pool.  \nNo opportunity cost of hodling crypto is assumed.  \nI understand that many of these assumptions are not always accurate. Especially the last one, when it comes to PoS coins. Staking the underlying coin would negate a significant portion of liquidity pool returns when compared to hodling.  \n\n**Calculations**:  \nBased on these assumptions, I calculated the comparison of pooling vs. hodling using iterative daily compounding. I then created a scenario table for a series of possible APRs and annualized price movements. Here's what it ended up looking like:  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/Jhp2oFN.png  \nFor those interested in the actual calculations, I've uploaded the excel file [here](https://github.com/Karegohan-And-Kamehameha/pool-calculator/blob/main/pool%20calculator.xlsx). You will need to enable iterative calculations for it to work. The file also contains a couple of simplified models, which are less accurate.  \n**Interpretation**:  \nAs can be seen from the table, it is always better to pool than to hodl if you don't expect the price of the underlying asset to lose more than half its value or to more than double.  \nFor APRs north of 20%, which is reasonable for most pools, you're even better off if the asset loses 75% of its value or triples in value.  \nMoreover, pooling at an APR of 20% will be profitable even if the underlying asset loses 35% of its value over the year, which would result in a huge loss for hodlers. And, needless to say, compounding interest will do wonders for your portfolio in multiyear scenarios, provided that price action is sufficiently low.  \nPooling does, however incur significant losses compared to hodling if the price of the underlying asset goes to the moon (5X or more in under a year) or sinks below 10%. But, IMO, that scenario is unlikely for the top 20 coins.  \n**Final thoughts**:  \nNone of this applies to low cap shitcoins, the prices of which experience extreme fluctuations all the time. But then again, many of those pools also have significantly higher APR that what I have in my model, so go figure.  \nIt would also be interesting to look at pools of pairs of high cap coins instead of just ones paired with a stablecoin. For positively correlated coins (which is basically all of them), this should make Impermanent Loss smaller. But it would also increase market exposure and prevent you from gaining a high APR on the fiat part of the pool.  \nI'm also assuming that the smart contracts of the pools are secure and that there is no market risk of the fiat currency, which is not necessarily always the case, but that's a can of worms I'd rather keep closed for now.  \nAs pooling inherently decreases market risk, except for black swan events, it could be argued that it can be used to increase one's market exposure to a crypto, which could compensate for some of the losses incurred in the case of a strong upwards move.  \nNow, I'd love to hear your thoughts. And if someone can check my calculations, I'd appreciate that.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm going to leave this post up for a couple of days and afterwards I am going to delete it. Take notes. (EDIT: The reason why I want to delete this after a few days is to protect my own security habits. At some commenters' request I will leave it up for longer than a couple of days. Perhaps a couple of weeks then. Do know that this will be deleted eventually. Do not save this post, copy and paste it to your own notes.) \n\nSo a lot of you are losing money by using poor cybersecurity practices. Most of my friends and people online say I'm a bit overkill and paranoid. I think everyone should be overkill and paranoid about their online security. Cybersecurity isn't \"for the nerds\" anymore. A lot of companies, governments and black hats are after your stuff for one reason or another and you need to wise up. \"but i don't have anything to hide...\" <- Zip it! Your computer and your phone hold more info than your closest friends. Believe me, you do have something to hide. That information can and will be used against you by anyone who can get to it.\n\nI decided to write a quick post giving you a layman's introduction to protecting your stuff and where you can further educate yourself. Without further ado, here's the paranoia guide to internet privacy and security, volume I:\n\nPasswords: \n\nPasswords are the keys to your stuff. You should never reuse passwords. You should only have one password, that is, the password of your password manager. That's it. Password managers are encrypted databases that hold your passwords and usernames, plus some extra notes if you wish. You use them by copying and pasting the info from the database to your login forms. They have specific security features for this purpose, therefore they're the right tool for this job (for instance, they clear your clipboard 15 seconds after you copied your login/password to prevent clipboard leak).\n\nYou program your manager to create as complex of a password as you want, but I find that 15 characters long with numbers and special characters in the mix are the best, as in case you need to use an external computer, you don't wanna be spending too much time typing in a password manually.\n\nThere are two types, offline and online. I prefer offline because I'm paranoid. Whatever is not in the cloud or accessible online is safer. If someone manages to hijack your browser or phish you, they may get access to your online manager. If someone manages to hack your account, they may get access to your online manager. Most people that use an online manager are fine. They have good programmers taking care of security. Still...\n\nMy recommendations are: For online Bitwarden. It's open source and endorsed by the best cybersecurity nerds here on reddit. For offline, Keepass. Works with windows, you can put it in a flash drive and also works with android. Do put it in a dedicated flashdrive or two, because if your computer breaks, there goes all your passwords.\n\n\"But wasn't Keepass hacked?\" <- No. The machine where they hacked keypass, using a program called keyfarse, was compromised. That brings me to:\n\nMachine security:\n\nA lot of you use windows. Linux is much safer, but also can be a PITA to use sometimes. If you're gonna use windows (which I also do), make sure to use an antivirus and run regular scans (at least once a month). Which ones? Avast, karspersky, bitdefender, eset are the most recommended ones. Pair it up with malware bytes for a beefed up malware defense as well. ccleaner is great to tune up your machine, but I also use it to remove start up programs easily, in order to kill bloatware or infection vectors.\n\n**However** like my cybersecurity teacher once told me, an antivirus is something that will protect you after you already messed up. It's a cure, not a defense. Someone has to get infected in order for the programmers to create a defense for it. So your true line of defense are your internet habits. Make sure your machine is updated. A lot of security holes are constantly being patched around the clock and delivered to you via updates. Updating is a slog, but it is important. \n\nAlso, a lot of infection vectors come from pirated software and games. DYOR on the best piracy practices here on reddit (I shall say no more, nor link any more websites because I know some mods are touchy with it).\n\nBrowser:\n\nA lot of people use chrome. Some people are into brave. I personally recommend Firefox. Firefox is the tried and true staple of anonymity and cyber security. It might not give you tokens, but hey it's pretty good at what it does. The default firefox is pretty good, but using extensions makes it perfect. Go into security settings, set up Do not track, HTTPS everywhere and jack up browser security to strict. Disable autofill, disable save passwords and logins (that's what the manager's for). I use the same on my android phone. For your phone you'll have to copy your keepass database manually using a cable every time you update it.  PROTIP: You can save your address/cc card as a login info for easy form filling. You can also save your cc card expiration date and emergency numbers too, in case your card gets stolen you can cancel it quickly.\n\nExtensions:\n\nI recommend you install ublock origin (I know, I know, support websites. However, ads are a massive vector of malware. You can always unblock your favorite sites), privacy badger, privacy possum (anti trackers), multiaccount containers and descentraleyes. On android there's no option for HTTPS everywhere, so you should use the extension HTTPS everywhere. Every extension has an explanation page, but if you wanna know more, I can give you the quick version. Just ask.\n\nIf you're good with computers, noscript and cleanlinks are good choices. The reason I say \"if you're good with computers\" is because these two extensions will break everything. Malware runs on scripts and trackers track you on tracking links, but so do normal website operations.\n\n2FA:\n\n**Do not use sms 2FA**. Several people have come here and to other cybersecurity subreddits because they were hacked this way. Your sim card can be cloned and someone else can get the same sms as you. In a pinch, you can use google authenticator, but what you should actually be using is yubikeys. Yubikeys are 2FA devices that will unlock your account via USB or via NFC. They're great, unhackable (so far), portable, offline, safe and only cost 50 bucks. Have more than one, because if your single yubikey breaks, then you have another.  Yes, you can attach more than one key to your account. They work with most of the popular services (google, microsoft, amazon, facebook, instagram, etc...) and, best of all, they work with keepass.\n\nE-mail:\n\nHave a secret e-mail that no one knows about and use it as a recovery e-mail in case all else fails. I personally use protonmail for my secret recovery e-mail. It also gets the e-mails in case my main e-mails gets an unauthorized access.\n\nLikewise have a crap e-mail that you give to everyone who gatekeeps you from accessing what you want in exchange for an e-mail. I check that one once per give away, to confirm the link they send me. You can set up filters to forward the stuff you need easily.\n\nNever click on links on your e-mail. Got an e-mail from Netflix? Manually use your browser to get to Netflix.\n\nReduce social engineering sources:\n\nI don't know how you feel about social media, however I hacked my first account at 13 using info I got from social media of a friend. How did I do that? Well his security question was \"what color is my house\" and his profile pic was in front of his house. I didn't mess (too much) with his account, but it shows how easy it is to gather info from your social media and use it against you. Be careful with what you put on social media. Another way I can easily steal your info is if you use my computer and I change the save login and password settings to save yours. *Check the browser you are using and make sure your info isn't being stolen*. Nevertheless a keylogger can be running in the background, so better yet, do not put your credentials in a computer that you yourself aren't managing. Do not open, under any circumstances, your keepass database in a computer that you aren't managing. Also be aware of running your mouth on social media, particularly on reddit. Your post history is not private. You only need so many crumbs to pull off social engineering hacks. Loose lips sink ships!\n\nCrypto:\n\nOk now onto crypto. As you are well aware, the best crypto storage device is a hardware wallet, like a Ledger or a Trezor. Do use a passphrase. As for your security key, keep it in a steel wallet. They are impervious to fires, floods and kind of secure but also super obvious to who's in crypto. If you're a digital nomad and you're roaming around, perhaps writing it in somewhere clever, say, a book, might be better to get through airport security. If you wanna store your mnemonic extra securely, I recommend several steel wallets and using Shamir's secret sharing technique using slip-0039. In short, it allows you to spread your seed over, say, 3 cards and you need all 3 to reset your hardware wallet. That means you can entrust those cards to someone (responsible, so they don't lose it) and they can't do anything with it. Or you can have 5 cards and need 3 out of 5 to get to your mnemonic. DYOR about SSS using Slip-0039.\n\nWhat you should not do is invent your own cryptographic scheme (unless you're some sort of cryptographic genius) because you will create something that's less secure than what's out there, easier to crack and, worse even, you might forget what was your scheme.\n\nVPN:\n\nTom Scott published a video saying VPNs were less useful than you might think and mocking adverts of VPNs. I recommend you watch it on Youtube for impartiality's sake. I honestly don't agree with it. I mean, he has many good points, browser security is pretty good nowadays and VPNs can be redundant. However, governments can still know which websites you're visiting and can keep you from accessing certain websites you want to access. Corporations will also have a harder time pinning you down with a VPN. I recommend a VPN. Personally i use wevpn, because it's super cheap. It costs money, but it removes internet gatekeepers and gives you that extra privacy bump. Do remember to rotate servers to try and mitigate the risk of landing on a compromised VPN server.\n\nThere's so much more that I'd love to tell you but it's getting pretty long. I didn't cover cloud services and hard drive encryption. Some other time perhaps.\n\nMore info:\nr/privacy\nr/europrivacy\nr/cybersecurity\nr/privacytoolsio\n\nKeep yourself safe and anonymous. I'm open to suggestions and criticisms, so if your method is better than my method, please share your method so I can use it too. Feel free to copy and paste it, even if you do not credit me. It's not a paranoia guide that's gonna make me famous.\n\nPS: This is advice for accessing the clear web. This is inadequate advice to access the darknet (because it's not relevant for this sub).",

            "selftext": "When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, he invented censorship resistant peer to peer digital cash. Bitcoin's censorship resistance meant that supply was defined mathematically and no party on earth no matter how powerful or rich could change supply or reverse a transaction. Bitcoin marked the beginning of a transition from government backed money (whose supply is expanded at the discretion of a politically controlled/influenced Central Bank) to cryptographic money (supply controlled by an open source algorithm everyone can verify). Bitcoin created a level playing field, where any market participant can succeed or fail, in contrast to government backed *playing fields* where market participants enjoy privileges depending on how close they are to those governing. The recent COVID handouts are a [case in point](https://twitter.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1406205116437258251). \n\nBitcoin brought us freedom, because with Bitcoin trade *can be* truly borderless. Technically speaking, nothing stops us from paying someone in the other side of the globe for goods and services. Technically speaking again, Bitcoin also allows us to trade goods and services anonymously without having to trade off our financial privacy. Bitcoin brings us freedom, but this profound freedom comes with additional responsibilities and risks that new bitcoin users are often unfamiliar with. For one, counterparty risk is extremely high when using bitcoin to conduct peer to peer trades. Bob posts a listing online selling beanies, Alice pays for a beanie but Bob never delivers anything. If Alice  used Bitcoin she has no recourse whatsoever but to warn others that Bob is a scammer. Another common fraud scheme that a lot of early bitcoiners have seen is that of fundraising in Bitcoin for a new project and then running away with the money without ever actually building anything in return. Secondly, as result of this counterparty risk, and the need for trusted 3rd parties, in practice this leads to less censorship resistance. For example, to trade bitcoin we have to go through an exchange that matches buy and sell orders and guarantees both sides of the trade have enough collateral to close the trade. What happens is that as soon as these commerce hubs grow beyond a critical size they come under the purview of government regulation. This means that we are forced to trade off financial privacy again, which in turn can be used against us. In addition these regulated hubs also act as gatekeepers to trading with crypto, since if you get banned then you effectively cannot trade crypto without excessive counterparty risk. \n\nNow it should be clear how although bitcoin *technically* is peer to peer censorship resistant digital cash, *in trade*, because of counterparty risk, it is rarely peer to peer and rarely censorship resistant. It is exactly here that defi comes into play, decentralized finance fundamentally means to enable Alice and Bob to conduct a trade online, peer to peer, at zero counterparty risk. This is the basis of any defi, and since we are in crypto, the first step would be to allow Alice to buy ETH from Bob with her BTC in an incentive compatible fashion. Incentive compatible means that none of the participants has an incentive of deviating from their commitment. In other words, this means that if Alice sends her BTC to Bob first, then Bob has no incentive to walk out of the trade because Alice is made whole anyway. To achieve this different DeFi protocols take different approaches. Decentralization is what actually really matters in my opinion for any defi to be defi. Without decentralization counterparty risk will always be too high. DINO (Decentralized In Name Only) defi instead of eliminating central points of failure, they displace them from A to B. B is a better hidden place which as result creates an illusion of decentralization which in my opinion is even more dangerous than openly centralized options like exchanges. For example, if Alice uses a validator based DeFi, then she sends the money to Bob through a validator V, which is supposed to return the money to Alice if Bob doesn't send his ETH. While it's true that Alice no longer has to trust Bob, she still needs to trust the validator since if the validator colludes with Bob is bribed by Bob then Alice would still lose her money.\n\nIn a proof of work DeFi (Overline), on the other hand, a decentralized network of miners checks if Alice sent her BTC to Bob and if Bob sent his ETH to Alice. Miners request both Alice and Bob to provide a sending and receiving address, which then they monitor to verify if the respective trades are sent or not. This is done cryptographically, which means that miners must provide cryptographic proof that Alice didn't deliver her BTC or that Bob didn't deliver his ETH. Based on this proof, which is verified by the network, then either the collaterals are frozen or they are transferred from one counterparty to the other depending on who walked out of the trade. This is peer to peer feeless nd also *wireless* trading (no internet connection required). We can finally buy & sell stuff without having to shake hands with our counterparty and without having to go through custodians. All this at zero fraud risk thanks to proper proof of work based (cryptographic) decentralization. I believe Overline is uniquely positioned to capture most of the real defi market, since it has no real competitors. By real defi market I mean those users that need real defi and have been waiting on the sidelines for a solution. I don't think current Defis meet the decentralization requirement of low trust users (which tend to be the ones with the highest capital at stake). \n\nThe implications of the tech go far beyond crypto trading. The protocol constitutes a rock solid foundation on top of which to build an entire ecosystem where even real estate or art can be traded trustlessly with the help of tokenization. We could buy and sell pieces of a building without ever having to share our identity with the counterparty, in complete privacy. Same for art, wouldn't it be great to buy a Picasso without anyone knowing you're the owner? I believe Overline makes the DeFi Utopia real",
